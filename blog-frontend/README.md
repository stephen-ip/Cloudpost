# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the first iteration of a social media posting site that currently supports users posting text paragraphs as well as image (png, jpg, gif) and video (mp4) file contents.
The like and dislike feature also works as intended, and the next steps for this project will be making user profiles and accounts to keep track of post creators, since right now, everything is annonymous under a non-unique username.
